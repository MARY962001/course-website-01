## Introduction to Immersive Technology

🔍 What is Immersive Technology?

🕶️ Virtual Reality: Users get to interact through a simulated reality. Vision and hearing is stimulated. The goal is to immerse into a virtual world and prevent from seeing the real world. VR is about 75% virtual and 25% real.

📱 Augmented Reality: Amplifies real-world surroundings adding virtual features that the user may interact with. Augmented reality doesn’t try to immerse and block out the real world - it overlays graphics and animation on top of real-world environments. AR is about 25% virtual and 75% real.

## VR vs. AR in Real Estate
